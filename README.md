# mq-uniform-clusters

Uniform clusters are a specific pattern of an IBM MQ cluster that provides a highly available and horizontally scaled small collection of queue managers. These queue managers are configured almost identically, so that an application can interact with them as a single group.

**IBM MQ 9.1.x** introduced the ability to define a Uniform Cluster, This makes it easier to configure a set of matching queue managers and adds intelligent balancing of connected applications, ensuring messaging workload and processing is spread evenly across the queue managers.

## Demo

This [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWELgaEDGs0) takes you through a very simple demo of a Uniform Cluster containing three queue managers. Many of the scripts and configuration to run this demo can be found in ['demo/Linux'](demo/Linux).

As well as the Linux demo, a demo using Docker can be found in ['demo/Docker'](demo/Docker), or for M1 Macs, in ['demo/M1MacDocker'](demo/M1MacDocker)

['request-reply'](request-reply) contains a more advanced variant of the demonstration using the requester-responder application pattern.  It provides sample C applications demonstrating relevant features of the MQ API, and does therefore require a suitable development environment to compile and run these applications.

['pubsub'](pubsub) demonstrates certain publish subscribe scenarios which can work well in Uniform Clusters, by avoiding single queue manager affinities.
